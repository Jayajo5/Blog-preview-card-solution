## My process
I started by analyzing the provided design and breaking it into sections. The main structure consists of a container with a Blog preview card image and a text description.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned hover effect for a smoother user experience. 
- Learned how to put small image on a container.
```css
.text h3:hover{
    cursor: pointer;
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued development

- In future projects i want to learn more CSS properties.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - This helped me for Centering in CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox) - This is an amazing free resource which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
